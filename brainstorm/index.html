            <p>Now that you've completed a tutorial and learned how to use GameMaker, it's time for you to start working on your game jam game! Whether you have some really cool ideas or haven't thought of anything yet, you're probably asking the question:</p>
            <p><span>What makes a good game jam game?</span></p>
            <p>The best game jam games are the ones inspired by what you already play! Use games you love as reference to come up with ideas and undestand what makes the game fun. Here are a few examples of my favorite games from various game jams: <span class="green">(don't get too distracted, you still have a game to make!)</span></p>

            <p>Don't worry if those games feel out of reach, remember that these are a collection of my favorites, and everyone has to start somewhere. Overall, I think there are 3 key aspects to making a good game for a game jam:</p>

            <p><span>think SMALL</span><br/>Game jams are short, and during the game showcase most people will only play your game for a few  minutes. It's really easy to dream big and come up with all sorts of content and features, but in a game jam it's best to create a short, contained experience.</p>

            <p><span>Then, add a twist</span><br/> Adding an interesting twist to a simple concept can make a game fun and unique. This is where you can use the theme to turn your idea into a memorable experience</p>

            <p><span>Finally, polish</span><br/>A good game jam game is easy to grasp and play. Even if it's a simple game, people will enjoy your game if it is well put together and feels good to play. Test your game, ask other people to test your game, and FINISH your game. The best games are finished ones!</p>

            <p>If done correctly, these three aspects <span>(simple, polished, and unique)</span> should come together to create a <span>magical moment</span> where someone playing your game thinks: <span>Oh, this is cool!</span> <br/>These moments are what make your game memorable and exciting both for you and your players, so as you're making your game remember to ask yourself:</p>
            <p>How am I going to create a <span>magical moment</span> for my players?</p>
