                    <p>it's time to ship your game! here's a quick checklist before you ship:<br/> - does my game have a win condition?<br/> - does my game adhere to the theme? (stuck in a loop)<br/> - does my game use different art than the default tutorial art?<br/> - after making this game, do i feel ready to help other people make great games at my event?</p>
                    <p>first, go to <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io,</a> create an account, and go to <a href="https://itch.io/dashboard">your dashboard</a></p>
                    <p>from here, click <span>Create new project</span> and customize your page! you add a directions, upload images, and many more.</p>
                    <p>once, you're done, go back to GameMaker and click <span>Build</span> in the top left corner, and click <span>Create Executable > Package as Zip</span> and save the zip file to anywhere you'd like</p>
                    <p>then, on itch.io, click <span>Upload files</span> and upload the zip folder you just created <span class="green">(if you can't find it, it's probably in you project folder, the same place where your github repository is)</span></p>
                    <p>next, change <span>Kind of project</span> on itch.io to <span>HTML</span> and under the folder you uploaded check <span>This file will be played in the browser</span></p>
                    <p>change the <span>Viewport Dimensions</span> to 1366x768 (or whatever the size of your viewport is, it should be in the bottom left of the room editor)</p>
                    <p>you can now click <span>Save and View Page</span> to see your game's website</p>
                    <p>once you have everything working, click <span>Draft</span> at the top and change <span>Visibility and access</span> to <span>Public</span> and save.</p>
                    <p>now you're done, share your game with us <a href="https://forms.hackclub.com/campfire-training">here</a> to get cool things!</p>
