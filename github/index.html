                    <p>now, lets learn how to use version control via github!</p>
                    <p>source control is a way to keep track of any changes you make to your project, so you can revert back if you end up accidentally breaking something. more importantly, source control is how you'll collaborate with your friends at campfire!</p>
                    <p>first go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and create an account. once you've done that, download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/" target="_blank">github desktop</a> and log in.</p>
                    <p>next, click <span>Create a New Repository on your local drive</span> and set the <span>Local path</span> the the location of your <span>Gamemaker Projects</span> folder.</p>
                    <p>you can find the location of your <span>Gamemaker Projects</span> in the gamemaker editor by clicking <span>File > Save As</span> and copying the address bar of your file explorer</p>
                    <p>then, change the <span>Name</span> to the name of your game's folder and click <span>Create Repository</span></p>
                    <p class="green"> see the images on the right for how it should look, make sure your games name doesn't have spaces in it!</p>
                    <p>now, hit <span>Publish repository</span> and your all set! You can click <span>View on GitHub</span> to see repository's website</p>
                    <p>as you make changes to you project, (make sure you save your project regularly) you will see changes in github desktop, then you can commit them to main (essentially save your changes) and push it origin (upload your changes to github)</p>
