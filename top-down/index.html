                    <p>also, download my assets here: <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KkpG0I7GCsrUS6qMbJWTw0K3L5zbrgMA/view?usp=sharing">link</a></p>
                    <p>next, open gamemaker (may take a little bit on the first time) and click <span>New > Game > Blank Pixel Game</span> and change the <span>Project Name</span> to something cool, <span class="green">(make sure it doesn't have any spaces in it! it'll matter later)</span></p>
                    <p>then it should open up your game editor! its a lot to take in, but i'll walk you through it. first close out of the welcome tab and lets get started!</p>

                    <p>sprites are the images of your game. they represent your enemies, backgrounds, and your heidi.</p>
                    <p>to make a sprite, right click on the blank space in the <span>Asset Browser</span> and click create group and call it <span>Sprite.</span> then, right click on that folder and click <span>Create -> Sprite</span> and call it <span>sPlayer</span>. </p>
                    <p>(you can call it whatever you want, but i promise this naming scheme makes things super easy) </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>now, you can import your sprite! normally you should make your own sprite but i made one for you this time. you can just hit <span>Import</span> and select the player sprite from my asset pack from the last slide. <span class="green">make sure to click yes in the popup!</span></p>
                    <p>notice that each of these sprites are 16x16 pixels. generally, pixel art is done on a grid, where each sprite is either 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. this makes everything look neat and super easy to work with.</p>

                    <p>since sprites are the images of your game, they can’t really do much by themself, but you can attach them to objects to make some really cool things. </p>
                    <p>create a new folder for <span>Objects</span>, and right click on the folder and select <span>Create -> Object</span>. call it <span>oPlayer</span> and assign the <span>sPlayer</span> sprite to it. </p>

                    <p>to make sure your game scales correctly, in the <span>Inspector</span> on the left, scroll down and open <span>Viewports and Cameras.</span> then, enable viewports, make <span>Viewport 0 visible</span>, and change the <span>Camera Properties</span> of <span>Viewport 0</span> to 320x180 <br/>(not the <span>Viewport Properties</span>!)</p>
                    <p>you should also change the grid size in the top right corner of the room editorto 16x16 so the objects snap to the grid. (check the image on the right)</p>
                    <p>now, make a level! switch back to the <span>Instances</span> layer so you can add objects, and then you can drag in the objects from the asset browser into the room, or after selecting an object you can hold alt and click and drag to paint an object into the room. here’s what i made -></p>

                    <p>this creates a variable for movement in the x and y directions and uses keypresses to add our movement_speed to these variables</p>

                    <p>next, lets make heidi face the direction she moves. add this to your code:</p>

                    <p>if you try this, you'll notice heidi teleports every time she flips, this is because she flips around the "origin" of her sprite, which isn't the center</p>

                    <p>this will serve as a parent object for all of our solid objects, meaning that we could add all sorts of things to its children like rocks and buildings, and if we check that heidi collides with oSolid it will include collisions with all of its children.</p>
                    <p>go in your <span>Step</span> event and replace this:</p>

y += y_speed</pre>

                    <p>i think you can try this by yourself this time, go ahead and make a <span>Create</span> and <span>Step</span> in <span>oSlime</span> and create a variable for movement speed in the create event (same think you did for oPlayer)</p>
                    <p><span class="green">you cant just call the variable "speed" here since speed is a different variable that is built into gamemaker. it you try it, you'll see that the variable name turns green, and if that ever happens you should choose a different variable name</span></p>
                    <p>next, the function we use for enemy behavior is really simple:</p>
                    <pre class="code">
mp_potential_step(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, (your movement speed variable), true)</pre>
                    <p>this is super cool built in gamemaker function that can automatically pick a path for your enemies to move in. you just need the x and y locations that it should try to move towards (in this case the players x and y) and the movement speed</p>
                    <p>dont worry about the last input, you should just always put true there</p>
                    <p>now the enemies will run towards you!</p>
